## References and Input Data

The input dataset used in this project is the 2017 US National Household Travel Survey (https://nhts.ornl.gov/), which contains four sets of data - Households, Persons, Trips, and Vehicles. For this project, I utilized the data on households and vehicles. The data were collected through surveys conducted from April 2016 to May 2017 by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) with members of a sample size of households across the country.

Documentation available for the dataset are the Data User Guide (https://nhts.ornl.gov/assets/2017UsersGuide.pdf) and the Codebook (https://nhts.ornl.gov/assets/codebook_v1.1.pdf).
